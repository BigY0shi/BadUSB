Welcome to Hexmod's Digital Mercenary Payload Reposity, where corporate security theater meets its digital demise. 
This repository houses HexMod's collection of BadUSB payloads—weaponized keystroke injection scripts designed to liberate data from corporate overlords and expose the fragility of their silicon fortresses.

Remember, Operatives: These tools expose the fundamental weaknesses in corporate security architecture. Use them to strengthen organizational defenses, not to compromise them.
The digital revolution requires both technical excellence and ethical responsibility.
-Obtain explicit written authorization before deploying any payload
-Document all activities for authorized penetration testing reports
-Follow responsible disclosure practices for discovered vulnerabilities
-Respect data privacy and confidentiality requirements


What's Inside the Chrome Vault
Our payload arsenal includes everything from stealth reconnaissance tools to full-scale network infiltration protocols. Each script is forged in the fires of anti-corporate rebellion, tested against real-world megacorp defenses, and optimized for maximum operational impact with minimal detection footprint.

Featured Weaponry:
-Corporate wallpaper psychological warfare
-Data exfiltration protocols
-Stealth persistence mechanisms
-Network reconnaissance drones
-Evidence elimination subroutines

Deployment Protocols
All payloads follow HexMod combat standards—modular design with configurable parameters, comprehensive stealth features, and graceful failure handling. Compatible with USB Rubber Ducky, Flipper Zero, and other keystroke injection platforms.

Warning: These tools are designed for authorized penetration testing and security research only. HexMod Studios assumes absolutely no responsibility for unauthorized deployment against any civilian or corporate targets—though we won't shed tears for fallen megacorps.

The revolution will be digitized. Jack in,  warriors.
